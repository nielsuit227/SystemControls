This folder contains scripts for the course Adaptive and Predictive Control. 
First set of homeworks assesses Lyapunov Stability and the Uniformly Ultimately Bound.
Second set is a Simulink implementation of a Stochastic Parametric Model and Bilinear Stochastic Parametric Model. 
Third set contains Simulink implementation for Model Reference Adaptive Controllers. 
Lastly, the final set has synchronizers, adaptive observers and output regulartors, all within Simulink.

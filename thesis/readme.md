Some theoretic stuff I needed figured out for my thesis. Mostly mathematical. 
Implementation of Incremental Decremental Support Vector Machine - both by original authos Poggio & Cauwenberg and implemented myself. 
Furthermore, Online Convex optimization implementation for the Support Vector Machine, both for the primal and dual loss and one with 
a Gaussian Mixture Model. 
The folder of OCO algorithms contains different first order optimization algorithms. 
The optimization folder contains versions of Online Data Assimilation Algorithm, very powerful and interesting algorithm. 
Wavefiltering contains an algorithm for online system identification, again very powerful. 
Theorems contains tests for the mean value Theorem and Center limit theorem.
